# Topical-modelling
Topical modelling using dimensionality reduction and dendograms, and using LSTMs
monitor the training process of LDA with the help of evaluation metrics available for topic models in gensim (Coherence, Perplexity, Topic diff and Convergence), as knowing about the progress and performance of a model, as we train them, could be very helpful in understanding itâ€™s learning process and makes it easier to debug and optimize them.
